    "Logging is a crucial aspect of any application, providing a way to track events, error and operational information. Python's built-in logging module offers a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging means recording important messages while a program runs.\n",
    "It helps us understand what the program is doing, and find errors easily.\n",
    "Instead of using print(), logging is professional, more organized, and can save messages to a file."

    "## Logging Levels\n",
    "Python logging module has several log levels indicating the severity of events. The default events are : \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. DEBUG\n",
    "This is the lowest level.\n",
    "Used for very detailed information.\n",
    "Helps during development to see the internal values, steps, and flow.\n",
    "Not shown to users—only for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“Value of x inside loop is 10”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. INFO\n",
    "Used to show normal messages.\n",
    "Tells what the program is doing in a normal situation.\n",
    "No problems, just updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“User logged in successfully”\n",
    "“File downloaded”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. WARNING\n",
    "Something unexpected happened, but the program can still continue.\n",
    "It’s a minor issue that may cause a problem later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“Low disk space, only 10% left”\n",
    "“Retrying connection…”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. ERROR\n",
    "A major problem occurred.\n",
    "The program failed to do something, but the whole program may still continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "“Could not open file: file not found”\n",
    "“Database connection failed”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. CRITICAL\n",
    "The highest level.\n",
