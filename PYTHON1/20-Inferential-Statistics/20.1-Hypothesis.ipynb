    "# 📘 Hypothesis and Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Hypothesis\n",
    "In statistics, a **hypothesis** is a **statement or assumption** made about a **population parameter** (such as mean or proportion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we usually cannot study the entire population, we:\n",
    "- Take a **sample**\n",
    "- Perform **statistical analysis**\n",
    "- Draw conclusions about the **population**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process belongs to **Inferential Statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential statistics** is the branch of statistics that helps us:\n",
    "- Make **conclusions**\n",
    "- Draw **inferences**\n",
    "- Take **decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "about a **population**, based on **sample data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes:\n",
    "- Sample → Statistical Analysis → Conclusion → Population\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **Hypothesis Testing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "**Hypothesis testing** is a **statistical mechanism** used to:\n",
    "- Test an assumption about a population\n",
    "- Decide whether to **accept or reject** that assumption based on data\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps answer questions like:\n",
    "- Is a person guilty or not?\n",
    "- Is a coin fair or biased?\n",
    "- Is the average different from what is claimed?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Real-Life Intuition (from notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Person → Crime → Court\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start by assuming the person is **not guilty**\n",
    "- Evidence is collected\n",
    "- Based on evidence, we decide guilt or innocence\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic is exactly how **hypothesis testing works** in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Basic Structure of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing always involves:\n",
    "1. Making an initial assumption  \n",
    "2. Collecting sample data  \n",
    "3. Performing statistical analysis  \n",
    "4. Taking a decision  \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision is based on **probability and evidence**, not guesswork.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📘 Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Definition of Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Null Hypothesis**, denoted by **H₀**, is a **statement of no effect, no difference, or no change** in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents the **default or initial assumption** that nothing unusual has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Meaning of Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis assumes that:\n",
    "- Any observed difference in sample data is due to **random chance**\n",
    "- The population parameter has **not changed**\n",
    "- There is **no significant effect**\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, **H₀ is assumed to be true initially**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Why Do We Start with Null Hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with H₀ because:\n",
    "- It is a **conservative assumption**\n",
    "- It avoids jumping to conclusions\n",
    "- It requires **strong evidence** to be rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the legal principle:\n",
    "- A person is assumed **innocent until proven guilty**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Examples of Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Coin Toss\n",
    "H₀: The coin is fair\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Probability of Head = 0.5\n",
    "- Probability of Tail = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Population Mean\n",
    "H₀: μ = 50\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- The population mean is assumed to be 50\n",
    "- Any difference seen in sample is due to chance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Exam Results\n",
    "H₀: There is no difference in average marks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Key Points about Null Hypothesis\n",
    "- Denoted by **H₀**\n",
    "- Assumes **no effect or no difference**\n",
    "- Always includes **equality (=, ≤, ≥)**\n",
    "- It is the hypothesis that we **test directly**\n",
    "- It is either **rejected or not rejected**"
