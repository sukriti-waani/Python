    "# 📘 Bayesian Statistics and Bayes’ Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian statistics** is an approach to **data analysis and parameter estimation** based on **Bayes’ theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses:\n",
    "- Prior knowledge\n",
    "- Observed data\n",
    "- Probability theory\n",
    "\n",
    "to update our belief about an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Probability and Types of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory, events can be classified into:\n",
    "- **Independent events**\n",
    "- **Dependent events**\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification is important to understand Bayes’ theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Independent Events\n",
    "Two events are called **independent** if the occurrence of one event **does not affect** the occurrence of the other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Rolling a Dice\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample space:\n",
    "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of each outcome:\n",
    "P(1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(2) = 1/6\n",
    "...\n",
    "P(6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Each outcome is independent of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Tossing a Coin\n",
    "\n",
    "P(H) = 0.5, P(T) = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting head does not affect the probability of getting tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Dependent Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Two events are called **dependent** if the occurrence of one event **affects** the probability of the other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example (from notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "A box contains colored balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- Event R = picking a **Red** ball  \n",
    "- Event Y = picking a **Yellow** ball  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes:\n",
    "P(R) = 2/5\n",
    "P(Y) = 3/4 (after red is chosen)\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Conditional Probability\n",
    "**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring **given that another event has already occurred**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is written as:\n",
    "P(A | B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "- Probability of A given B is true\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula for Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly:\n",
    "P(B | A) = P(A and B) / P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Joint Probability Property\n",
    "\n",
    "From probability rules:\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(B and A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using conditional probability:\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B | A)\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(B) · P(A | B)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Derivation of Bayes’ Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since:\n",
    "P(A) · P(B | A) = P(B) · P(A | B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging the equation:\n",
    "P(B | A) = [P(B) · P(A | B)] / P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is called **Bayes’ Theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Bayes’ Theorem Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B | A) = (P(B) · P(A | B)) / P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- A, B are events\n",
    "- P(B | A) → Posterior probability\n",
    "- P(B) → Prior probability\n",
    "- P(A | B) → Likelihood\n",
    "- P(A) → Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Meaning of Terms (from notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `P(A | B)`  \n",
    "  Probability of event **A given B is true**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `P(B | A)`  \n",
    "  Probability of event **B given A is true**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `P(A)` and `P(B)`  \n",
    "  Independent probabilities of events A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Dataset Interpretation Using Bayes’ Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes, consider a **house price dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent Variables (Features)\n",
    "x₁ = Size of house\n",
    "x₂ = Number of rooms\n",
    "x₃ = Location\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependent Variable (Output)\n",
    "y = Price\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Bayes’ Theorem for Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of price given features is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(y | x₁, x₂, x₃)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes’ theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(y | x₁, x₂, x₃) = [P(y) · P(x₁, x₂, x₃ | y)] / P(x₁, x₂, x₃)\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is highlighted in the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Interpretation in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- `P(y)` → Prior belief about price  \n",
    "- `P(x₁, x₂, x₃ | y)` → Likelihood of features given price  \n",
    "- `P(y | x₁, x₂, x₃)` → Updated belief (prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "This forms the foundation of **Bayesian models** such as:\n",
    "- Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "- Bayesian inference"
