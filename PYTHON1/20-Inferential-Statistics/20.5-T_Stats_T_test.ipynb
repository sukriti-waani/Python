    "# 📘 One-Sample t-Test (Worked Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the population, the **average IQ is 100**.  \n",
    "A team of researchers wants to test a **new medication** to see whether it has:\n",
    "- a positive effect,\n",
    "- a negative effect, or\n",
    "- no effect at all on intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample of 30 participants** who have taken the medication has:\n",
    "- Sample mean IQ = 140\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:  \n",
    "**Did the medication affect intelligence?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Level = 95%  \n",
    "Significance Level = α = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Identify Given Information\n",
    "\n",
    "From the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Population mean (μ) = 100\n",
    "Sample size (n) = 30\n",
    "Sample mean (x̄) = 140\n",
    "Sample standard deviation (s) = 20\n",
    "Significance level (α) = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Since:\n",
    "- Population standard deviation is **unknown**\n",
    "- Sample size is **finite**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **one-sample t-test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: State the Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "\n",
    "H₀ : μ = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "yaml\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the medication has **no effect** on intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n",
    "\n",
    "H₁ : μ ≠ 100\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **two-tailed test**, because we are checking for **any change** (increase or decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Choose Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "α = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "This corresponds to a **95% confidence level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Degree of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-sample t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Degrees of freedom (df) = n − 1\n",
    "df = 30 − 1 = 29\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Decision Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **two-tailed test** with:\n",
    "α = 0.05\n",
    "df = 29\n",
    "\n",
    "From the t-table, the **critical t-value** is approximately:\n",
    "\n",
    "t₀.₀₂₅,₂₉ ≈ ±2.045\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "If t < −2.045 or t > +2.045 → Reject H₀\n",
    "Otherwise → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "The rejection regions lie in **both tails**, each with **2.5% area**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Calculate the Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-statistic formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (x̄ − μ) / (s / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (140 − 100) / (20 / √30)\n",
    "t = 40 / (20 / 5.48)\n",
    "t = 40 / 3.65\n",
    "t ≈ 10.96\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Make the Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculated t-value:\n",
    "t = 10.96\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical value:\n",
    "t_critical = ±2.045\n",
    "\n",
    "Since:\n",
    "10.96 > 2.045\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic falls in the **rejection region**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we **reject the null hypothesis (H₀)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 8: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **sufficient statistical evidence** to conclude that:\n",
    "- The medication **has affected intelligence**\n",
    "- The mean IQ after medication is **significantly different from 100**\n",
    "- Since the sample mean is higher, the medication has **increased intelligence**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The medication used **has significantly increased intelligence**, based on a **one-sample two-tailed t-test at 5% significance level**."
