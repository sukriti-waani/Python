    "# 📘 Student’s t-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Student’s t-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the **Student’s t-distribution** is used when we want to perform **statistical analysis on the sample mean**, but the **population standard deviation is unknown**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Z-statistics, we assume that the **population standard deviation (σ)** is already known.  \n",
    "However, in most real-world problems, **σ is not known**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this situation, we use the **Student’s t-distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Why Do We Need Student’s t-Distribution?\n",
    "### Case 1: Z-Statistics\n",
    "When performing analysis using **Z-score**, we require:\n",
    "- Population standard deviation **σ** to be known\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score formula:\n",
    "Z = (x̄ − μ) / (σ / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 2: Real-Life Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "- Population standard deviation **σ is usually unknown**\n",
    "- We only have **sample data**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question arises:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we perform analysis when σ is unknown?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "→ By using **Student’s t-distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Student’s t-Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "When σ is unknown, we replace it with the **sample standard deviation (s)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **t-statistic** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (x̄ − μ) / (s / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- x̄ = sample mean  \n",
    "- μ = population mean (from H₀)  \n",
    "- s = sample standard deviation  \n",
    "- n = sample size  \n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is highlighted in the notes under **t stats**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Difference Between Z-Statistic and t-Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Z-Statistic | t-Statistic |\n",
    "|------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| Population σ | Known | Unknown |\n",
    "| Standard deviation used | σ | s (sample SD) |\n",
    "| Distribution used | Normal distribution | t-distribution |\n",
    "| Table used | Z-table | t-table |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ t-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the t-statistic for hypothesis testing, the test is called a **t-test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes:\n",
    "t-table → t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "- Compute t-value\n",
    "- Compare with critical value from **t-table**\n",
    "- Make a decision on H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Nature of Student’s t-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **symmetric** like the normal distribution\n",
    "- It is **bell-shaped**\n",
    "- It has **heavier tails** than the normal distribution\n",
    "- As sample size increases, it **approaches normal distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because uncertainty decreases with more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Degree of Freedom (DOF)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The **degree of freedom (DOF)** represents the number of values that are **free to vary** while calculating a statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Student’s t-distribution:\n",
    "DOF = n − 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example from Notes\n",
    "If:\n",
    "n = 3 (3 people)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "DOF = 3 − 1 = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly shown in the handwritten notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Why Degree of Freedom is (n − 1)?\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the sample mean:\n",
    "- One value is fixed by the mean\n",
    "- Remaining values are free to vary\n",
    "\n",
    "So only **n − 1 values are independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ When Do We Use Student’s t-Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "Student’s t-test is used when:\n",
    "- Population standard deviation **σ is unknown**\n",
    "- Sample size is **small**\n",
    "- Data is approximately **normal**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣0️⃣ Summary of Student’s t-Distribution Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z-test requires **σ (population SD)**\n",
    "- When σ is unknown → use **s (sample SD)**\n",
    "- Replace Z with **t**\n",
    "- Use **t-table instead of Z-table**\n",
    "- Degrees of freedom = **n − 1**"
