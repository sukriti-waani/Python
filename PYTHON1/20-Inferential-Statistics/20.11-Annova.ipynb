    "# 📘 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to ANOVA\n",
    "**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is a statistical test used to determine whether there are **significant differences between the means of three or more groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of comparing means directly, ANOVA compares **variations (variances)** to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Why ANOVA is Used\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare multiple group means using repeated t-tests:\n",
    "- Probability of error increases\n",
    "- Results become unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA solves this by:\n",
    "- Performing **one single test**\n",
    "- Controlling the **Type I error**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Hypotheses in ANOVA\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "All group means are equal\n",
    "μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ = ... = μₖ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n",
    "At least one group mean is different\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Basic Idea Behind ANOVA\n",
    "ANOVA compares:\n",
    "- **Variation between groups**\n",
    "- **Variation within groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the variation **between groups** is much larger than the variation **within groups**, then the group means are considered significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Test Statistic in ANOVA (F-Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA uses the **F-statistic**, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = Variance Between Groups / Variance Within Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "If F is large → strong evidence against H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Assumptions of ANOVA\n",
    "ANOVA is valid only when the following assumptions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Independence\n",
    "- Observations are independent of each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normality\n",
    "- Data in each group is approximately normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Homogeneity of Variance\n",
    "- All groups have **equal variances**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also called **homoscedasticity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Types of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ One-Way ANOVA\n",
    "- Used when there is **one independent factor**\n",
    "- Compares means of **three or more groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Effect of teaching method on student performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Two-Way ANOVA\n",
    "- Used when there are **two independent factors**\n",
    "- Studies:\n",
    "  - Main effect of factor 1\n",
    "  - Main effect of factor 2\n",
    "  - Interaction effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Effect of teaching method and gender on marks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Repeated Measures ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Same subjects measured multiple times\n",
    "- Used in **time-based or condition-based studies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Blood pressure before, during, and after treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ MANOVA (Multivariate ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used when there are **multiple dependent variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Effect of diet on weight and cholesterol level\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Partitioning of Variations in ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The total variation in data is divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Variation = Between-Group Variation + Within-Group Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Total Sum of Squares (SST)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures the **total variation** in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SST = Σ (xᵢⱼ − x̄)²\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- xᵢⱼ = individual observation\n",
    "- x̄ = grand mean\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures variation due to differences **between group means**.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSB = Σ nᵢ (x̄ᵢ − x̄)²\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- nᵢ = sample size of group i\n",
    "- x̄ᵢ = mean of group i\n",
    "- x̄ = grand mean\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures variation **within each group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSW = Σ Σ (xᵢⱼ − x̄ᵢ)²\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Relationship Between Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "SST = SSB + SSW\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is the core idea of **partitioning of variation in ANOVA**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣3️⃣ Mean Squares in ANOVA\n",
    "To compute the F-statistic, we calculate **mean squares**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Square Between Groups (MSB)\n",
    "MSB = SSB / (k − 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Square Within Groups (MSW)\n",
    "MSW = SSW / (N − k)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- k = number of groups\n",
    "- N = total number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣4️⃣ Final ANOVA Test Statistic\n",
    "F = MSB / MSW\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣5️⃣ Decision Rule\n",
    "- Calculate F-value\n",
    "- Find critical F-value from F-table\n",
    "- Compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "If F_calculated > F_critical → Reject H₀\n",
    "If F_calculated ≤ F_critical → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",

    "- Medical experiments\n",
    "- Business analytics\n",
    "- Quality control\n",
    "- Machine learning model comparison"
