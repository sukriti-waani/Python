    "# 📘 Chi-Square (χ²) Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Chi-Square Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Chi-Square (χ²) test** is a **non-parametric statistical test** used to examine whether there is a **significant difference between observed data and expected data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mainly used for:\n",
    "- **Categorical data**\n",
    "- **Frequency data**\n",
    "- Testing relationships or distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ When is Chi-Square Test Used?\n",
    "The Chi-square test is used when:\n",
    "- Data is in the form of **counts or frequencies**\n",
    "- Variables are **categorical**\n",
    "- Sample size is reasonably large\n",
    "- Expected frequency in each category is preferably ≥ 5\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Types of Chi-Square Tests\n",
    "There are mainly **two types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test**\n",
    "2. **Chi-Square Test of Independence**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Chi-Square Test Statistic\n",
    "The chi-square test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "χ² = Σ [(Oᵢ − Eᵢ)² / Eᵢ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- Oᵢ = observed frequency\n",
    "- Eᵢ = expected frequency\n",
    "- Σ = sum over all categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Meaning of the Chi-Square Statistic\n",
    "- It measures the **difference between observed and expected frequencies**\n",
    "- Larger χ² value means **greater difference**\n",
    "- Smaller χ² value means **observed data is close to expected data**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Hypotheses in Chi-Square Test\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "There is no significant difference between observed and expected frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n",
    "There is a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Degree of Freedom (General)\n",
    "The degree of freedom depends on the type of chi-square test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For goodness of fit:\n",
    "df = k − 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- k = number of categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Decision Rule\n",
    "- Calculate χ² using the formula\n",
    "- Find critical χ² value from chi-square table\n",
    "- Compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "If χ²_calculated > χ²_critical → Reject H₀\n",
    "If χ²_calculated ≤ χ²_critical → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📘 Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Introduction to Goodness of Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test** checks whether **sample data follows a specified theoretical distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us how well the **observed data fits the expected distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Purpose of Goodness of Fit Test\n",
    "Used to check if data follows:\n",
    "- Uniform distribution\n",
    "- Binomial distribution\n",
    "- Poisson distribution\n",
    "- Any given theoretical distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Hypotheses for Goodness of Fit\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "The observed frequencies follow the expected distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n",
    "The observed frequencies do not follow the expected distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Steps in Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test\n",
    "### Step 1\n",
    "State H₀ and H₁\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "Calculate expected frequencies (Eᵢ)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "Compute chi-square statistic:\n",
    "χ² = Σ [(Oᵢ − Eᵢ)² / Eᵢ]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4\n",
    "Find degree of freedom:\n",
    "df = k − 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5\n",
    "Find critical value from chi-square table\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6\n",
    "Make decision based on comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣3️⃣ Example (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a dice is rolled many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected frequency:\n",
    "Each face = Total throws / 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Observed frequency:\n",
    "Actual counts from experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply chi-square formula to check if dice is **fair or biased**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣4️⃣ Applications of Chi-Square Goodness of Fit\n",
    "- Checking fairness of dice or coins\n",
    "- Market research (customer preferences)\n",
    "- Genetics (phenotype distribution)\n",
    "- Quality control\n",
    "- Machine learning (feature distribution analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣5️⃣ Important Points to Remember\n",
    "- Used for **categorical data**\n",
    "- Based on **frequencies**, not raw values\n",
    "- Sensitive to sample size\n",
    "- Expected frequencies should not be too small\n",
    "- Non-parametric test (no normality assumption)"
