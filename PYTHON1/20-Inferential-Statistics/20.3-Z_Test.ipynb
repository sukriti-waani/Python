    "# 📘 Significance Level (α)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Definition of Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "The **significance level**, denoted by **α (alpha)**, is the **maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:\n",
    "- α is the **risk we are willing to take**\n",
    "- It represents the chance of making a **wrong decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Meaning of Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level decides:\n",
    "- How strong the evidence must be\n",
    "- To reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "A **smaller α** means:\n",
    "- Stricter testing\n",
    "- Less chance of rejecting H₀ incorrectly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Common Values of α\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used significance levels are:\n",
    "- α = 0.05 (5% significance level)\n",
    "- α = 0.01 (1% significance level)\n",
    "- α = 0.02 (2% significance level)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 95% confidence level → α = 0.05\n",
    "- 98% confidence level → α = 0.02\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Relationship Between Confidence Level and α\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship is:\n",
    "α = 1 − Confidence Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Confidence Level = 95% → α = 0.05\n",
    "Confidence Level = 98% → α = 0.02\n",
    "\n",
    "This relation is explicitly written in the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Role of α in Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level **sets the decision boundary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It divides the distribution into:\n",
    "- **Acceptance region**\n",
    "- **Rejection region**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only results falling in the rejection region lead to rejection of H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ α and Rejection Region (Two-Tailed Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **two-tailed test** with:\n",
    "α = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The rejection area is split as:\n",
    "0.025 on the left tail\n",
    "0.025 on the right tail\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical Z-values:\n",
    "−1.96 and +1.96\n",
    "\n",
    "This is shown clearly in the bell-curve diagram in the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ α and Rejection Region (One-Tailed Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **one-tailed test**:\n",
    "- Entire α is placed on **one side** of the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Example from notes:\n",
    "α = 0.02\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejection region lies entirely in:\n",
    "- Left tail (or right tail depending on H₁)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Decision Rule Using α\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule is:\n",
    "- If p-value ≤ α → Reject H₀\n",
    "- If p-value > α → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison is explicitly done in both numerical examples in the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Important Points About Significance Level\n",
    "- α is chosen **before testing**\n",
    "- It is not calculated from data\n",
    "- Smaller α → stronger evidence required\n",
    "- Controls the probability of **Type I error**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📘 Z-Test\n",
    "## 1️⃣ What is a Z-Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Z-test** is a **statistical hypothesis test** used to determine whether the **sample mean** is significantly different from the **population mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the **standard normal distribution (Z-distribution)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ When Do We Use a Z-Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Z-test is used when **all the following conditions are satisfied**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population standard deviation **σ is known**\n",
    "- Sample size is **large (n ≥ 30)**\n",
    "- The population distribution is **normal**  \n",
    "  OR  \n",
    "  Sample size is large enough to apply **Central Limit Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions are clearly indicated in your notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Purpose of Z-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-test helps us to:\n",
    "- Decide whether to **reject or not reject H₀**\n",
    "- Check if the observed sample mean is due to **random chance**\n",
    "- Test claims about the **population mean**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Z-Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Z-test statistic** is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (x̄ − μ) / (σ / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- x̄ = sample mean  \n",
    "- μ = population mean (from H₀)  \n",
    "- σ = population standard deviation  \n",
    "- n = sample size  \n",
    "\n",
    "This formula standardizes the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Meaning of Z-Score in Z-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-value tells us:\n",
    "- How many **standard errors** the sample mean is away from the population mean\n",
    "- How far the sample result is from what is expected under H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "A large |Z| value indicates strong evidence against H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Types of Z-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) Two-Tailed Z-Test\n",
    "Used when:\n",
    "H₁ : μ ≠ μ₀\n",

    "H₁ : μ > μ₀\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejection region lies on the **right side**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (iii) Left-Tailed Z-Test\n",
    "Used when:\n",
    "H₁ : μ < μ₀\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejection region lies on the **left side**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Decision Rule Using Z-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two equivalent methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Critical Value Approach\n",
    "- If |Z| > Z_critical → Reject H₀\n",
    "- If |Z| ≤ Z_critical → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: P-Value Approach\n",
    "If p-value ≤ α → Reject H₀\n",
    "If p-value > α → Fail to reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Common Critical Z-Values\n",
    "For commonly used significance levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "α = 0.05 (two-tailed) → Z = ±1.96\n",
    "α = 0.01 (two-tailed) → Z = ±2.58.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Interpretation of Z-Test Result\n",
    "- If H₀ is rejected → sample evidence supports H₁\n",
    "- If H₀ is not rejected → insufficient evidence against H₀\n",
    "- Rejection does **not prove H₁ true**, it only shows strong evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Important Points About Z-Test\n",
    "- Used only when σ is known\n",
    "- Suitable for large samples\n",
    "- Based on normal distribution\n",
    "- Widely used in quality control and research"
