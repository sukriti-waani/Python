    "## 1️⃣ Background: Reality vs Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, there are **two things** to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reality\n",
    "- Null hypothesis (H₀) is **true**\n",
    "- Null hypothesis (H₀) is **false**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision\n",
    "- We **reject** the null hypothesis\n",
    "- We **retain (fail to reject)** the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these two possibilities, **four outcomes** are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Outcome 1: Correct Decision (Good)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Situation\n",
    "Reality: Null hypothesis is false\n",
    "Decision: We reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The null hypothesis is actually false\n",
    "- We correctly reject it\n",
    "- This is a **good decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means our statistical test worked correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Outcome 2: Type I Error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Situation\n",
    "Reality: Null hypothesis is true\n",
    "Decision: We reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The null hypothesis is actually true\n",
    "- But we reject it incorrectly\n",
    "- This is called a **Type I Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A **Type I Error** occurs when we **reject a true null hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Outcome 3: Type II Error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Situation\n",
    "Reality: Null hypothesis is false\n",
    "Decision: We retain the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The null hypothesis is actually false\n",
    "- But we fail to reject it\n",
    "- This is called a **Type II Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A **Type II Error** occurs when we **fail to reject a false null hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Outcome 4: Correct Decision (Good)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Situation\n",
    "Reality: Null hypothesis is true\n",
    "Decision: We retain the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The null hypothesis is true\n",
    "- We correctly retain it\n",
    "- This is a **good decision**\n",

    "## 6️⃣ Summary of All Four Outcomes (Conceptual Table)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Reality of H₀ | Decision Taken | Result |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------|--------|\n",
    "| H₀ is false | Reject H₀ | Correct decision |\n",
    "| H₀ is true | Reject H₀ | Type I Error |\n",
    "| H₀ is false | Retain H₀ | Type II Error |\n",
    "| H₀ is true | Retain H₀ | Correct |decision |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Probability of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of **Type I Error** = α  \n",
    "  This is the **significance level**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of **Type II Error** = β  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- α = P(rejecting H₀ when it is true)\n",
    "- β = P(retaining H₀ when it is false)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Important Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type I Error is considered **more serious**\n",
    "- α is chosen **before** testing\n",
    "- Lower α reduces Type I Error but may increase Type II Error\n",
    "- There is a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors"
