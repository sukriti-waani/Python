    "# 📘 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Definition of Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Alternative Hypothesis**, denoted by **H₁** or **Hₐ**, is a **statement that contradicts the null hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents the claim that:\n",
    "- There **is an effect**\n",
    "- There **is a difference**\n",
    "- The assumption made in the null hypothesis is **not true**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Meaning of Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis suggests that:\n",
    "- The observed result is **not due to random chance**\n",
    "- There is a **real change or effect** in the population\n",
    "- The population parameter is **different from what H₀ claims**\n",
    "\n",
    "It reflects what we want to **prove using data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Relationship Between H₀ and H₁\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H₀** and **H₁** are always **opposites**\n",
    "- If H₀ is rejected, H₁ is accepted\n",
    "- If H₀ is not rejected, H₁ cannot be proven\n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes:\n",
    "H₀ : Coin is fair\n",
    "H₁ : Coin is not fair\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Examples of Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Coin Toss\n",
    "H₀ : Coin is fair\n",
    "H₁ : Coin is not fair\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Probability of Head is **not equal to 0.5**\n",
    "- Probability of Tail is **not equal to 0.5**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Population Mean\n",
    "H₀ : μ = 50\n",
    "H₁ : μ ≠ 50\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the true population mean is **different from 50**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Types of Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) Two-Tailed Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "H₁ : μ ≠ μ₀\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates deviation on **both sides**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) Right-Tailed Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "H₁ : μ > μ₀\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (iii) Left-Tailed Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "H₁ : μ < μ₀\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Key Points about Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "- Denoted by **H₁ or Hₐ**\n",
    "- Represents **research claim**\n",
    "- Does **not include equality**\n",
    "- Accepted only when **H₀ is rejected**\n",
    "- Supported by **strong statistical evidence**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📘 P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Definition of P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **p-value** is the **probability of obtaining a result as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed result**, assuming that the **null hypothesis (H₀) is true**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:\n",
    "- It tells us **how strong the evidence is against H₀**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Meaning of P-Value\n",
    "The p-value measures:\n",
    "- How likely the observed sample result is\n",
    "- When the null hypothesis is assumed to be true\n",
    "\n",
    "A **small p-value** means:\n",
    "- The observed result is **very unlikely** under H₀\n",
    "- There is **strong evidence against H₀**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **large p-value** means:\n",
    "- The observed result is **likely** under H₀\n",
    "- There is **weak evidence against H₀**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Intuition Behind P-Value\n",
    "Think of p-value as:\n",
    "- A **measure of surprise**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is very small:\n",
    "- The result is too surprising to occur by chance\n",
    "- The null hypothesis may not be true\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is large:\n",
    "- The result is not surprising\n",
    "- The null hypothesis can still be true\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Example to Understand P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coin Toss Example\n",
    "Assume:\n",
    "H₀ : Coin is fair\n",
    "\n",
    "If we toss a coin many times and get mostly heads:\n",
    "- The p-value tells us **how likely such a result is**\n",
    "- If the p-value is very small, the coin is probably **not fair**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Decision Rule Using P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare the p-value with a **significance level (α)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value ≤ α → Reject H₀\n",
    "If p-value > α → Do not reject H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Common Significance Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently used values of α:\n",
    "α = 0.05 (5% level)\n",
    "α = 0.01 (1% level)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Interpretation of P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "- p-value = 0.03  \n",
    "  → There is a **3% chance** of observing such data if H₀ is true  \n",
    "\n",
    "- p-value = 0.40  \n",
    "  → There is a **40% chance** of observing such data if H₀ is true  \n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller p-values indicate **stronger evidence** against H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Important Points about P-Value\n",
    "- P-value is **not the probability that H₀ is true**\n",
    "- It only measures evidence **against H₀**\n",
    "- Smaller p-value → stronger evidence\n",
    "- Used directly in **hypothesis testing decisions**"
