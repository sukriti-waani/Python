    "# 📘 When to Use Z-Test vs t-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Purpose of This Decision Rule\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, choosing the **correct test** is very important.  \n",
    "This decision rule helps us decide **whether to use a Z-test or a t-test** based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Knowledge of population standard deviation\n",
    "- Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowchart in the notes visually represents this decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Step 1: Do You Know the Population Standard Deviation (σ)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know the population standard deviation (σ)?\n",
    "\n",
    "yaml\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "\n",
    "This question divides the decision into two cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Case 1: Population Standard Deviation (σ) is Known\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer is **YES**, then move to the next question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the sample size greater than or equal to 30?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1(a): Sample Size ≥ 30\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "σ is known\n",
    "and\n",
    "n ≥ 30\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "- Large sample size\n",
    "- Population variability is known\n",
    "- Sampling distribution of the mean follows normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This path is shown on the **left-bottom side** of the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1(b): Sample Size < 30\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "σ is known\n",
    "but\n",
    "n < 30\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "- Small sample size\n",
    "- More uncertainty\n",
    "- t-distribution handles extra variability\n",
    "\n",
    "This is shown in the **left branch leading to t-test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Case 2: Population Standard Deviation (σ) is NOT Known\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer to the first question is **NO**:\n",
    "\n",
    "σ is not known\n",
    "\n",
    "Then directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "This is independent of sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "- In real-world problems, σ is usually unknown\n",
    "- We replace σ with sample standard deviation (s)\n",
    "- This introduces extra uncertainty\n",
    "- t-distribution is designed for this situation\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is shown on the **right side of the diagram**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Final Decision Logic (Text Form)\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete logic from the flowchart can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "If σ is known:\n",
    "- If n ≥ 30 → Use Z-test\n",
    "- If n < 30 → Use t-test\n",
    "- If σ is unknown:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Why This Rule is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prevents wrong test selection\n",
    "- Ensures correct probability distribution is used\n",
    "- Avoids incorrect conclusions\n",
    "- Widely used in exams, statistics, and data science\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Key Takeaway from the Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-test** is stricter and requires more information\n",
    "- **t-test** is flexible and used in most practical cases\n",
    "- Whenever in doubt and σ is unknown → **use t-test**"
