    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Uniform Distribution\n",
    "The **uniform distribution** is a probability distribution in which **all outcomes are equally likely** within a given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two types of uniform distributions**:\n",
    "1. **Continuous Uniform Distribution**\n",
    "2. **Discrete Uniform Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "A **continuous uniform distribution** is a probability distribution in which a continuous random variable can take **any value between two given bounds**, and **all values in this interval are equally likely**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also called a **rectangular distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Nature of Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a **continuous random variable**\n",
    "- Values lie between a **minimum (a)** and **maximum (b)**\n",
    "- Probability is calculated using a **Probability Density Function (PDF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notation:\n",
    "X ~ U(a, b)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: −∞ < a < b < ∞\n",

    "## 4️⃣ Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "The PDF of a continuous uniform distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = 1 / (b − a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n",
    "f(x) = 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the height of the graph is constant between `a` and `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n",
    "The CDF of a continuous uniform distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = 0 for x < a\n",
    "F(x) = (x − a) / (b − a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n",
    "F(x) = 1 for x > b\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF graph increases **linearly** from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Mean of Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "Mean (μ) = (a + b) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Median of Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "Median = (a + b) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Variance of Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "Variance (σ²) = (b − a)² / 12\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Example: Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "The number of candies sold daily at a shop is **uniformly distributed** between: a = 10 (minimum), b = 40 (maximum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability that daily sales lie between 15 and 30\n",
    "\n",
    "P(15 ≤ X ≤ 30)\n",
    "= (30 − 15) / (40 − 10)\n",
    "= 15 / 30\n",
    "= 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    " Probability that sales are greater than 20\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X > 20)\n",
    "= (40 − 20) / (40 − 10)\n",
    "= 20 / 30\n",
    "≈ 0.66 (66%)\n",

    "Probability of each outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = 1 / n = 1 / 6\n",
    "\n",
    "So: P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/6\n",
