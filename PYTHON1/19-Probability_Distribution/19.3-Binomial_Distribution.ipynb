    "# 📘 Binomial Distribution\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Binomial Distribution\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, the **binomial distribution** is a **discrete probability distribution** that models the **number of successes** in a fixed number of independent trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trial:\n",
    "- Has only **two possible outcomes** (success or failure)\n",
    "- Has the **same probability of success**\n",
    "\n",
    "A single success/failure experiment is called a **Bernoulli trial**, and a sequence of such trials forms a **Bernoulli process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Conditions for Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "A random experiment follows a **binomial distribution** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The experiment consists of **n fixed trials**\n",
    "2. Each trial has only **two outcomes** (success/failure)\n",
    "3. Trials are **independent**\n",
    "4. Probability of success **p remains constant**\n",
    "5. Each trial is a **Bernoulli trial**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Binomial Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- `X` = number of successes in `n` trials  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "X = 0, 1, 2, ..., n\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Notation of Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is denoted as:\n",
    "X ~ B(n, p)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `n` = number of trials  \n",
    "- `p` = probability of success in each trial  \n",
    "- `q = 1 − p` = probability of failure  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Parameters of Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of trials:  \n",
    "n ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of success:\n",
    "0 ≤ p ≤ 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of failure:\n",
    "q = 1 − p\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Support of Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The support (possible values of X) is:\n",
    "k ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., n}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `k` represents the **number of successes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "P(X = k) = C(n, k) · p^k · (1 − p)^(n − k)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n − k)!]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **binomial coefficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Mean\n",
    "Mean (μ) = n · p\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Variance\n",
    "Variance (σ²) = n · p · q\n",
    "\n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    " Standard Deviation\n",
    "σ = √(n · p · q)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Coin Toss Experiment\n",
    "A coin is tossed **5 times**.  \n",
    "Find the probability of getting **exactly 3 heads**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: \n",
    "n = 5, p = 0.5, k = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 3) = C(5, 3) · (0.5)^3 · (0.5)^2 \n",
    "= 10 × 0.125 × 0.25 \n",
    "= 0.3125\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2: Quality Control (from notes)\n",
    "A factory inspects **10 items**, where each item has a **10% chance of being defective**.  \n",
    "Find the probability of getting **exactly 2 defective items**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: n = 10, p = 0.1, k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:  P(X = 2) = C(10, 2) · (0.1)^2 · (0.9)^8 ≈ 0.1937\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PMF graph**: Shows probability for each value of `k`\n",
    "- **CDF graph**: Shows cumulative probability `P(X ≤ k)`\n",
    "\n",
    "As `n` increases, the binomial distribution becomes **smoother** and approaches a **normal distribution**.\n",
