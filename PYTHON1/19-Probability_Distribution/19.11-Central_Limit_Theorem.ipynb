    "# 📘 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a fundamental theorem in statistics that explains the behavior of the **sampling distribution of the sample mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It states that when we take a **large number of samples** from a population and compute their means, the distribution of those sample means tends to follow a **normal (Gaussian) distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens **regardless of the original population distribution**, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Sampling Distribution\n",
    "The **sampling distribution** is the probability distribution of a statistic (such as the mean) calculated from **all possible samples of a given size** drawn from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CLT, we mainly focus on the **sampling distribution of the mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Population Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the population random variable be:\n",
    "\n",
    "X ~ N(μ, σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- μ = population mean  \n",
    "- σ = population standard deviation  \n",
    "\n",
    "The population distribution can be:\n",
    "- Normal  \n",
    "- Binomial  \n",
    "- Poisson  \n",
    "- Skewed  \n",
    "- Any other distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Sample and Sample Mean\n",
    "Consider taking many samples of size `n` from the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "S₁ = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} → x̄₁\n",
    "S₂ = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} → x̄₂\n",
    "S₃ = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} → x̄₃\n",
    "...\n",
    "Sₘ = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} → x̄ₘ\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample produces a **sample mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Central Limit Theorem Statement\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately **normal** as the sample size increases, **irrespective of the population distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Role of Sample Size\n",
    "- If the population is **normal**, the sampling distribution of the mean is **normal for any sample size**\n",
    "- If the population is **not normal**, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal when:\n",
    "\n",
    "n ≥ 30\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is explicitly highlighted in the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Distribution of Sample Mean\n",
    "According to CLT, the sample mean follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "X̄ ~ N(μ, σ / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- μ = population mean  \n",
    "- σ = population standard deviation  \n",
    "- n = sample size  \n",
    "- σ / √n = standard error of the mean  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Mean of the Sampling Distribution\n",
    "The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "E(X̄) = μ\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the sample mean is an **unbiased estimator** of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Variance and Standard Deviation of X̄\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "Var(X̄) = σ² / n\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation (standard error):\n",
    "SD(X̄) = σ / √n\n",
    "\n",
    "As the sample size increases, the standard error **decreases**, making estimates more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Graphical Interpretation\n",
    "- The **population distribution** may be skewed or non-normal\n",
    "- The **sampling distribution of the mean** becomes bell-shaped\n",
    "- As `n` increases:\n",
    "  - The curve becomes **narrower**\n",
    "  - The spread decreases\n",
    "  - The distribution becomes more **Gaussian**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Why CLT is Important\n",
    "- Allows use of **normal distribution** for inference\n",
    "- Makes statistical analysis easier\n",
    "- Forms the basis for:\n",
    "  - Confidence intervals\n",
    "  - Hypothesis testing\n",
    "  - Many machine learning assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Applications of Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "- Estimating population parameters  \n",
    "- Quality control  \n",
    "- Survey analysis  \n",
    "- Finance and risk analysis  \n",
    "- Machine learning and data science  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- CLT explains the behavior of the **sampling distribution of the mean**\n",
    "- Sample means follow a **normal distribution** for large `n`\n",
    "- Works for **any population distribution**\n",
    "- Mean of X̄ = μ\n",
    "- Standard deviation of X̄ = σ / √n\n",
    "- Typically valid when `n ≥ 30`"
