    "# 📘 Poisson Distribution\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Poisson Distribution\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, the **Poisson distribution** is a **discrete probability distribution** that expresses the probability of a **given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space**, provided that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events occur **independently**\n",
    "- Events occur at a **constant average rate**\n",
    "- Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Nature of the Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a **discrete random variable**\n",
    "- It describes the **number of events** in a fixed interval\n",
    "- It uses a **probability mass function (PMF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples shown in the notes:\n",
    "- Number of people visiting a hospital every hour  \n",
    "- Number of people visiting a bank every hour  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Poisson Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "X = number of events occurring in a fixed interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "X = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Parameter of Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution has **one parameter**:\n",
    "\n",
    "λ (lambda)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `λ` = **expected (average) number of events** occurring in one time interval\n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes:\n",
    "λ = 3 → expected number of events per time interval\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "The probability that exactly `x` events occur is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = (e^(−λ) · λ^x) / x!\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `x = 0, 1, 2, ...`\n",
    "- `e ≈ 2.718`\n",
    "- `λ` = mean rate of occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Example: Computing a Poisson Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "From the notes:\n",
    "λ = 3, x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the PMF:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 5) = (e^(−3) · 3^5) / 5!\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the probability of **exactly 5 events** occurring in one interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Cumulative Probability in Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "To find probability such as:\n",
    "P(X ≤ 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "We add individual probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X ≤ 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Graphical Interpretation\n",
    "- The **x-axis** represents number of occurrences (x)\n",
    "- The **y-axis** represents probability P(X = x)\n",
    "- PMF curves for different values of λ are shown\n",
    "- As λ increases, the distribution shifts right and becomes more spread out\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Mean of Poisson Distribution\n",
    "Mean (μ) = E(X) = λ\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean of a Poisson distribution is equal to `λ`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Variance of Poisson Distribution\n",
    "Variance (σ²) = λ\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Standard Deviation\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ) = √λ\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Important Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poisson distribution is **discrete**\n",
    "- Only **one parameter (λ)**\n",
    "- Mean = Variance = λ\n",
    "- Used when events occur **randomly over time or space**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣3️⃣ Applications of Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of customers arriving at a bank per hour  \n",
    "- Number of calls received by a call center  \n",
    "- Number of accidents at a traffic signal  \n",
    "- Number of defects in a manufactured item  \n",
    "- Machine learning: modeling rare events  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Poisson distribution models **count of events in fixed intervals**\n",
    "- Parameter `λ` represents average rate of occurrence\n",
    "- PMF: `P(X = x) = (e^(−λ) λ^x) / x!`\n",
    "- Mean = λ\n",
    "- Variance = λ\n",
    "- Widely used in **statistics, probability, and data science**"
