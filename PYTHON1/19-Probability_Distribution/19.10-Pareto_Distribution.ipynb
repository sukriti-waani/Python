    "# 📘 Pareto Distribution (Power Law Distribution)\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Pareto Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Pareto distribution**, named after the Italian economist **Vilfredo Pareto**, is a **power-law probability distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used to describe situations where:\n",
    "- A **small number of causes** produce a **large portion of the effect**\n",
    "- Most values are small, and a few values are extremely large\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of distribution is also referred to as a **non-Gaussian distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Nature of Pareto (Power Law) Distribution\n",
    "- It is a **continuous distribution**\n",
    "- It is **highly right-skewed**\n",
    "- It exhibits **long-tail behavior**\n",
    "- Mean and variance can be very large or sometimes undefined\n",
    "- The distribution is not symmetric\n",
    "\n",
    "The long tail is clearly shown in the graph on page 1 of the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Power Law and Long-Tail Behavior\n",
    "In a power-law distribution:\n",
    "- The **head** contains a few very large values\n",
    "- The **tail** contains many small values extending far to the right\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as a **long-tail distribution**, where rare but extreme values have a strong impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ 80–20 Rule (Pareto Principle)\n",
    "The Pareto distribution follows the **80–20 rule**, also known as the **Pareto principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It states that:\n",
    "- **80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Mathematical Representation\n",
    "The probability of observing a value `x` in a power-law distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) ∝ x^(−α)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `α > 0` is the shape parameter\n",
    "- Larger values of `x` have much smaller probability\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Pareto Type I Distribution\n",
    "- Different curves correspond to different values of `α`\n",
    "- As `α` increases, the curve drops faster\n",
    "- Smaller `α` values produce heavier tails\n",
    "\n",
    "This explains why some systems have extreme imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Transformation to Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "Y = ln(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces skewness\n",
    "- Makes the distribution more symmetric\n",
    "- Converts power-law behavior closer to a **normal (Gaussian) distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation is shown visually as:\n",
    "Power Law → log transform → Log-Normal / Normal-like curve\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Box-Cox Transformation\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Reduce right skewness\n",
    "- Stabilize variance\n",
    "- Make data more suitable for modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a generalization of the log transformation and is useful in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ QQ Plot Interpretation\n",
    "After transformation:\n",
    "- A **QQ plot** is used to check normality\n",
    "- If points lie close to a straight line, the transformed data is approximately normal\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms whether the transformation was effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Real-World Examples (from notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: IT Industry\n",
    "- **80% of the entire project work is done by 20% of the team**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Software Defects\n",
    "- **80% of defects can be solved by fixing 20% of defects**\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate the Pareto principle in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Applications of Pareto Distribution\n",
    "- Wealth and income distribution\n",
    "- Project management\n",
    "- Software engineering (defects)\n",
    "- Social networks (followers, likes)\n",
    "- Natural resources\n",
    "- Economics and business analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Pareto distribution is a **power-law, non-Gaussian distribution**\n",
    "- It shows **long-tail behavior**\n",
    "- Follows the **80–20 rule**\n",
    "- A few values dominate the outcome\n",
    "- Log and Box-Cox transformations help normalize the data\n",
    "- Widely used in **statistics, economics, and data science**"
