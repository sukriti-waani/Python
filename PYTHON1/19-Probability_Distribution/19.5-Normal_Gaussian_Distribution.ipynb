    "# 📘 Normal (Gaussian) Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Normal (Gaussian) Distribution\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, the **normal distribution** (also called the **Gaussian distribution**) is a **continuous probability distribution** for a real-valued random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is widely used because many real-world phenomena naturally follow a normal pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Nature of the Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a **continuous random variable**\n",
    "- It is represented by a **probability density function (PDF)**\n",
    "- The graph is a **bell-shaped curve**\n",
    "- The distribution is **symmetric about the mean**\n",
    "- **Mean = Median = Mode**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Examples of Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples shown in the notes:\n",
    "- Weights of students in a class  \n",
    "- Heights of students in a class  \n",
    "- Iris dataset features (petal length, sepal length, petal width, sepal width)  \n",
    "- Measurement errors in experiments  \n",
    "\n",
    "These quantities vary continuously and cluster around a central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Normal Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Let: X = a continuous random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Then: X ∈ (−∞, +∞)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Parameters of Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has **two parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **μ (mu)** → Mean  \n",
    "- **σ² (sigma squared)** → Variance  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notation:\n",
    "X ~ N(μ, σ²)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- μ ∈ ℝ  \n",
    "- σ² > 0  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF of a normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = (1 / (σ √(2π))) · e^{ −(1/2) ((x − μ)/σ)² }\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- μ = mean  \n",
    "- σ = standard deviation  \n",
    "- e ≈ 2.718  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Graphical Interpretation\n",
    "- The curve is **bell-shaped**\n",
    "- The highest point occurs at **x = μ**\n",
    "- As σ increases, the curve becomes **wider**\n",
    "- As σ decreases, the curve becomes **narrower**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **area under the curve** represents probability and is always **equal to 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Mean of Normal Distribution\n",
    "The mean of a normal distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "μ = (Σ xᵢ) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "- It represents the **center** of the distribution\n",
    "- It divides the curve into two equal halves\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "### Variance:\n",
    "σ² = (Σ (xᵢ − μ)²) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Deviation:\n",
    "σ = √σ²\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance measures **spread**\n",
    "- Standard deviation gives **average deviation from the mean**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)\n",
    "For a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- About **68%** of values lie within **μ ± σ**\n",
    "- About **95%** of values lie within **μ ± 2σ**\n",
    "- About **99.7%** of values lie within **μ ± 3σ**\n",
    "\n",
    "Written as probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(μ − σ ≤ X ≤ μ + σ) ≈ 68%\n",
    "P(μ − 2σ ≤ X ≤ μ + 2σ) ≈ 95%\n",
    "P(μ − 3σ ≤ X ≤ μ + 3σ) ≈ 99.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ QQ Plot (Quantile–Quantile Plot)\n",
    "- A **QQ plot** is used to check whether data follows a normal distribution\n",
    "- If the points lie approximately on a straight line, the data is **normally distributed**\n",
    "- Deviations from the line indicate skewness or outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Important Properties\n",
    "- Continuous distribution  \n",
    "- Symmetric about the mean  \n",
    "- Mean = Median = Mode  \n",
    "- Total area under the curve = 1  \n",
    "- Defined over (−∞, +∞)\n",
    "\n",
