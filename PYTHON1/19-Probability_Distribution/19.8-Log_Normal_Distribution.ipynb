    "# 📘 Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "A **log-normal distribution** is a **continuous probability distribution** of a random variable whose **logarithm is normally distributed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- If `X` is log-normally distributed  \n",
    "- Then `Y = ln(X)` follows a **normal distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Mathematical Relationship\n",
    "If: X ~ Log-Normal(μ, σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then: Y = ln(X) ~ Normal(μ, σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently: X = exp(Y)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `ln()` is the **natural logarithm**\n",
    "- `exp()` is the **exponential function**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Nature of Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "- It is a **continuous random variable**\n",
    "- Values of `X` are **strictly positive** (X > 0)\n",
    "- The distribution is **right-skewed**\n",
    "- It is **not symmetric**\n",
    "- Mean, median, and mode are **not equal**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Shape of the Distribution\n",
    "- The graph is **right-skewed**\n",
    "- Most values are concentrated on the **left**\n",
    "- A long tail extends to the **right**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Comparison: Normal vs Log-Normal\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal distribution** is symmetric  \n",
    "- **Log-normal distribution** is right-skewed  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we take: ln(X)\n",
    "of a log-normal variable, the transformed data becomes **normally distributed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Graphical Interpretation\n",
    "### Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "- X-axis → original variable `X`\n",
    "- Y-axis → probability density\n",
    "- Right-skewed curve\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Role of Log Transformation\n",
    "Taking the **natural log**:\n",
    "Y = ln(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces skewness\n",
    "- Makes data more symmetric\n",
    "- Helps satisfy assumptions of normality\n",
    "- Useful in statistical modeling and machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ QQ Plot Interpretation\n",
    "- A **QQ plot** compares the quantiles of data with a normal distribution\n",
    "- If `ln(X)` is normally distributed, the QQ plot appears approximately as a **straight line**\n",
    "- This confirms log-normal behavior of the original data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Examples of Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "1. **Wealth distribution of the world**\n",
    "2. **Discussion forum → length of comments**\n",
    "3. **Length of chess games**\n",
    "4. **Dwell time on online articles (jobs, news)**\n",
    "5. **Salaries of employees in a company**\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases:\n",
    "- Values are positive\n",
    "- Few very large values exist\n",
    "- Data is right-skewed\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Real-World Interpretation\n",
    "- Most people earn **moderate salaries**\n",
    "- A few individuals earn **very high salaries**\n",
    "- This creates a **long right tail**\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern matches a **log-normal distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ When to Use Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "- Data is **positive**\n",
    "- Data is **right-skewed**\n",
    "- Log-transformed data appears normal\n",
    "- Multiplicative growth processes are involved\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Applications of Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "- Income and wealth modeling  \n",
    "- Stock prices and financial returns  \n",
    "- File sizes and network traffic  \n",
    "- Time spent on tasks or websites  \n",
    "- Machine learning feature transformations  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Log-normal distribution is a **continuous distribution**\n",
    "- If `ln(X)` is normal, then `X` is log-normal\n",
    "- Distribution is **right-skewed**\n",
    "- Values are always **positive**\n",
    "- Log transformation converts it to a **normal distribution**\n",
    "- Widely used in **statistics, economics, and data science**"
