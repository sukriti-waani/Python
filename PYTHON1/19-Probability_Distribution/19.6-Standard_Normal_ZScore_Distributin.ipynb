    "# 📘 Standard Normal Distribution and Z-Score\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the **Standard Normal Distribution (SND)** is a special case of the **normal distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a continuous probability distribution where:\n",
    "- Mean (μ) = 0\n",
    "- Standard Deviation (σ) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution is widely used to **standardize data** and compare values from different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Normal Distribution Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is defined by two parameters:\n",
    "- Mean (μ)\n",
    "- Standard deviation (σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example dataset from notes:\n",
    "X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "μ = 3\n",
    "σ ≈ 1.414\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Standard Normal Distribution (SND)\n",
    "A **standard normal distribution** is a normal distribution that has been transformed so that:\n",
    "μ = 0\n",
    "σ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Notation:\n",
    "X ~ N(0, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation allows easier probability calculation and comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Z-Score\n",
    "A **Z-score** represents **how many standard deviations a value is away from the mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It converts any normal distribution into a **standard normal distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Z-Score Formula\n",
    "Z = (xᵢ − μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- xᵢ = data value\n",
    "- μ = mean\n",
    "- σ = standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Example: Converting Data to Z-Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "μ = 3\n",
    "σ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute Z-scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z(1) = (1 − 3) / 1 = −2\n",
    "Z(2) = (2 − 3) / 1 = −1\n",
    "Z(3) = (3 − 3) / 1 = 0\n",
    "Z(4) = (4 − 3) / 1 = 1\n",
    "Z(5) = (5 − 3) / 1 = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "So,\n",
    "Z = {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "This matches the transformation shown in the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Interpretation of Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z = 0 → value is exactly at the mean\n",
    "- Z > 0 → value is above the mean\n",
    "- Z < 0 → value is below the mean\n",
    "- Larger |Z| → farther from the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Example: Distance from the Mean\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "μ = 4\n",
    "σ = 1\n",
    "x = 4.25\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score:\n",
    "Z = (4.25 − 4) / 1 = 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "This means **4.25 is 0.25 standard deviations above the mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "x = 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score:\n",
    "Z = (2.5 − 4) / 1 = −1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "This means **2.5 is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Why Standard Normal Distribution is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows comparison between **different datasets**\n",
    "- Removes unit dependency (kg, cm, ₹, etc.)\n",
    "- Makes data **scale-free**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Standardization (Feature Scaling)\n",
    "**Standardization** is the process of converting features so that they have: Mean = 0, Standard Deviation = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using:\n",
    "Z = (xᵢ − μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Example: Dataset Standardization\n",
    "| Feature | Values |\n",
    "|-------|--------|\n",
    "| Age (yrs) | 24, 25, 26, 27, 30 |\n",
    "| Weight (kg) | 70, 60, 55, 40, 30 |\n",
    "| Height (cm) | 175, 160, 180, 130 |\n",
    "| Salary (₹) | 40k, 50k, 60k, 30k |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature has **different scales**.  \n",
    "Standardization converts them to a **common scale** using Z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Role of Z-Score in Machine Learning\n",
    "Standardization is required in many ML algorithms such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering Algorithms**\n",
    "2. **Linear Regression**\n",
    "3. **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "4. **K-Nearest Neighbors**\n",
    "5. **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures that no feature dominates due to larger magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Standard Normal Distribution has μ = 0 and σ = 1\n",
    "- Z-score measures distance from mean in standard deviations\n",
    "- Z-score formula: `(x − μ) / σ`\n",
    "- Standardization converts data to SND\n",
    "- Widely used in **statistics and machine learning**"
