    "# 📘 Power Law Distribution (Pareto Distribution)\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Power Law Distribution\n",
    "In statistics, a **power law distribution** describes a relationship between two quantities where a **relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in another quantity**, independent of the initial size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words:\n",
    "- A **small number of items contribute to a very large effect**\n",
    "- Most values are small, and a few values are extremely large\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Nature of Power Law Distribution\n",
    "- It is a **continuous distribution**\n",
    "- The distribution is **highly right-skewed**\n",
    "- It has a **long tail**\n",
    "- A few values dominate the entire distribution\n",
    "- Mean and variance may be very large or undefined in some cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Long-Tail Behavior\n",
    "In a power law distribution:\n",
    "- The **head** represents a few large values\n",
    "- The **tail** represents many small values\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **long-tail distribution**\n",
    "## 4️⃣ 80–20 Rule (Pareto Principle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Power law distributions often follow the **80–20 rule**, also called the **Pareto principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule states:\n",
    "- **80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Real-World Examples of Power Law Distribution\n",
    "Examples listed in the notes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IPL Matches**\n",
    "   - 20% of teams win 80% of the matches\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wealth Distribution**\n",
    "   - 80% of wealth is owned by 20% of the population\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Oil Resources**\n",
    "   - 80% of total oil belongs to 20% of nations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Language**\n",
    "   - Frequency of words in most languages follows a power law\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Software Defects**\n",
    "   - 20% of major defects cause 80% of system failures\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how **few contributors dominate outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Mathematical Representation\n",
    "A power law distribution is often written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) ∝ x^(−α)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `α` is a positive constant\n",
    "- Larger values of `x` occur with much smaller probability\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Relationship with Log Transformation\n",
    "When we apply **log transformation**:\n",
    "Y = ln(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The skewed power law curve becomes **more symmetric**\n",
    "- The transformed data may resemble a **normal distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Box-Cox Transformation\n",
    "The notes also show **Box-Cox transformation** as a generalization of log transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Reduce skewness\n",
    "- Stabilize variance\n",
    "- Make data closer to normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps in statistical modeling and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ QQ Plot Interpretation\n",
    "After transformation:\n",
    "- A **QQ plot** is used to compare data with a normal distribution\n",
    "- If points lie close to a straight line, the transformed data is approximately normal\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that power law data becomes manageable after transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Pareto Distribution\n",
    "The **Pareto distribution** is a specific type of power law distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used to model:\n",
    "- Wealth\n",
    "- Income\n",
    "- Resource distribution\n",
    "- City sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ Key Properties\n",
    "- Right-skewed distribution\n",
    "- Long-tail behavior\n",
    "- Few large values dominate\n",
    "- Often follows 80–20 rule\n",
    "- Log or Box-Cox transformation helps normalize data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣2️⃣ Applications of Power Law Distribution\n",
    "- Economics (wealth, income)\n",
    "- Social networks (followers, likes)\n",
    "- Natural resources\n",
    "- Software engineering (defects)\n",
    "- Linguistics (word frequencies)\n",
    "- Machine learning (feature distributions)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Power law distribution models **extreme imbalance**\n",
    "- A small number of elements create most of the impact\n",
    "- Follows **Pareto (80–20) principle**\n",
    "- Distribution is **right-skewed with a long tail**\n",
    "- Log or Box-Cox transformation helps convert it toward normality\n",
    "- Widely used in **statistics, economics, and data science**"
