    "## What is Multiplication Rule?\n",
    "The **Multiplication Rule** is used to find the probability of **two events occurring together**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is written as:\n",
    "P(A and B)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule depends on whether the events are:\n",
    "- **Independent**\n",
    "- **Dependent**\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Independent Events\n",
    "Two events are said to be **independent** if the occurrence of one event **does not affect** the occurrence of the other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Independent Events\n",
    "- Tossing a coin twice  \n",
    "- Tossing a coin and rolling a dice  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Multiplication Rule for Independent Events\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Tossing a Coin\n",
    "Event A = Getting Head (H)  \n",
    "Event B = Getting Tail (T)  \n",
    "\n",
    "P(H) = 1/2\n",
    "P(T) = 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying multiplication rule:\n",
    "P(H and T) = P(H) × P(T)\n",

    "##  Dependent Events\n",
    "Two events are **dependent** if the occurrence of one event **affects the probability** of the other event.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dependent events, we use **conditional probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Dependent Events\n",
    "Taking cards from a deck **without replacement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event A = Drawing a King (K)\n",
    "- Event B = Drawing a Queen (Q) after the King is removed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Conditional Probability\n",
    "Conditional probability means **probability of B given that A has already occurred**.\n",

    "It is written as:\n",
    "P(B | A)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events\n",
    "P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B | A)\n",

    "### Example: Cards from a Deck\n",
    "\n",
    "Total cards = 52  \n",
    "\n",
    "Event A = King  \n",
    "Event B = Queen after King is removed  \n",
    "\n",
    "P(K) = 4/52\n",
    "P(Q | K) = 4/51\n",
    "\n",

    "##  When to Use Which Rule?\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Use **independent multiplication rule** when events do **not affect** each other  \n",
    "-  Use **dependent multiplication rule** when probability **changes** after first event  \n",
