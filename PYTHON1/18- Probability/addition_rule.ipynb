    "## 1️⃣ Introduction to Probability\n",
    "**Probability** is the measure of how likely an event is to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability values always lie between **0 and 1**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P = 0** → Event will not occur  \n",
    "- **P = 1** → Event will surely occur  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Probability Formula\n",
    "P(Event) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Tossing a Coin\n",
    "Sample Space = {H, T}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Tossing a Coin\n",
    "P(H) = 1/2\n",
    "P(T) = 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Rolling a Dice\n",
    "Sample Space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Events in Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is a subset of the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- Getting **Head** in a coin toss  \n",
    "- Getting **5** in a dice roll  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "Two events are **mutually exclusive** if **they cannot occur at the same time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Tossing a coin:\n",
    "- Event A = Head (H)  \n",
    "- Event B = Tail (T)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both cannot happen together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Coin Toss\n",
    "P(H or T) = P(H) + P(T)\n",
    "= 1/2 + 1/2\n",
    "= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Rolling a Dice\n",
    "Event A = Getting 1  \n",
    "Event B = Getting 5  \n",
    "P(1 or 5) = P(1) + P(5)\n",
    "= 1/6 + 1/6\n",
    "= 2/6\n",
    "= 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non–Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Two events are **non-mutually exclusive** if **they can occur at the same time**.  \n",
    "They have **common outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Drawing a card:\n",
    "- Event A = King (K)  \n",
    "- Event B = Heart (♥)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **King of Hearts** belongs to both events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition Rule for Non-Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Cards from a Deck\n",
    "Total cards = 52  \n",
    "\n",
    "P(K) = 4/52\n",
    "P(♥) = 13/52\n",
    "P(K and ♥) = 1/52\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now apply formula:\n",
    "P(K or ♥) = 4/52 + 13/52 − 1/52\n",
    "= 16/52\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Do We Subtract P(A and B)?\n",
    "In **non-mutually exclusive** events, the common outcomes get counted **twice**.  \n",
    "Subtracting **P(A and B)** removes the double-counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Probability Formulas (Summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A or B) [Mutually Exclusive] = P(A) + P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A or B) [Non-Mutually Exclusive]\n",
    "= P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability measures likelihood of an event  \n",
    "- Sample space = all possible outcomes  \n",
    "- Mutually exclusive events cannot occur together  \n",
    "- Non-mutually exclusive events can occur together  \n",
    "- Addition rule depends on the type of events  "
