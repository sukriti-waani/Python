    "# 📊 Covariance and Correlation (Complete Explained Notes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation are statistical measures used to determine the **relationship between two variables**.\n",
    "They help us understand **how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship Between Variables\n",
    "A relationship between variables exists when a change in one variable **causes or is associated with a change in another variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- If study hours increase and exam score increases, the variables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates **the direction of the relationship between two variables** by showing how they change together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "| Change in X | Change in Y | Covariance |\n",
    "|------------|------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Increases | Increases | Positive |\n",
    "| Decreases | Decreases | Positive |\n",
    "| Increases | Decreases | Negative |\n",
    "| Decreases | Increases | Negative |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both variables move in the same direction → **Positive covariance**\n",
    "- If variables move in opposite directions → **Negative covariance**\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Covariance only shows **direction**, not strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition Examples\n",
    "- Size of house ↑ → Price ↑ → Positive covariance  \n",
    "- Distance from city ↑ → Price ↓ → Negative covariance  \n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance helps **quantify the relationship between X and Y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance Formula (Sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between X and Y is given by:\n",
    "Cov(X,Y) = Σ (xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ) / (n − 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "xᵢ = ith data point of variable X\n",
    "\n",
    "yᵢ = ith data point of variable Y\n",
    "\n",
    "x̄ = mean of X\n",
    "\n",
    "ȳ = mean of Y\n",
    "\n",
    "n = number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Important Property of Covariance\n",
    "Cov(X, X) = Var(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement:\n",
    "The covariance of a variable with itself is equal to its variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Limitations of Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance has no fixed range\n",
    "\n",
    "Values lie between −∞ and +∞\n",
    "\n",
    "Units depend on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficult to compare relationships across datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 To overcome these problems, correlation is used.\n"

    "## 2 Correlation\n",
    "Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates both the direction and the strength of the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is a standardized form of covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Covariance Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = Σ (xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ − ȳ) / (n − 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- σₓ = standard deviation of X\n",
    "- σᵧ = standard deviation of Y\n",
    "- Range of Pearson Correlation : -1 ≤ r ≤ +1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of r\n",
    "- r = +1\tPerfect positive linear relationship\n",
    "- r = 0\tNo linear relationship\n",
    "- r = −1\tPerfect negative linear relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "- As r → +1 → stronger positive correlation\n",
    "- As r → −1 → stronger negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Values closer to +1 indicate strong positive correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Values closer to −1 indicate strong negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spearman Rank Correlation\n",
    "Spearman rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship between two variables using their ranks instead of actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Rank Difference Formula)\n",
    "- ρ = 1 − [6 Σ dᵢ² / n(n² − 1)]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "R(X) = rank of X\n",
    "\n",
    "R(Y) = rank of Y\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Spearman Correlation\n",
    "- Relationship is non-linear\n",
    "- Data is ranked or ordinal\n",
    "- Dataset contains outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationship Between Covariance and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Corr(X, Y) = Cov(X, Y) / (σₓ · σᵧ)\n",

    "- Correlation is used in feature selection to remove redundant features.\n",
    "- Highly correlated features carry similar information\n",

    "- This improves model efficiency and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Size of house ↑ → Price ↑ (positive correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of rooms ↑ → Size ↑ (high correlation)\n",
    "\n",
