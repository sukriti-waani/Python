    "## Variable\n",
    "A variable is a property or characteristic that can take different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, anything that changes or varies is called a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender = Male\n",
    "\n",
    "Height = 172 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, age, gender, and height are variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are mainly divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 1. Quantitative Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative variables are numerical values that can be measured or counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are further divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (a) Discrete Quantitative Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes countable values\n",
    "\n",
    "Values are usually whole numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of students in a class\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of children in a family\n",
    "\n",
    "Tossing a coin (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- (b) Continuous Quantitative Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes measurable values\n",
    "\n",
    "Can have decimal values\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Height (175.5 cm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight (72.7 kg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Qualitative (Categorical) Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative variables describe qualities or categories, not numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender → Male / Female\n",
    "\n",
    "Colors → Red, Green, Blue\n",
    "\n",
    "Blood group\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Variable\n",
    "A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    " It converts outcomes into numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "Example 1: Tossing a Coin\n",
    "\n",
    "Let,\n",
    "\n",
    "X = 0 → Head\n",
    "X = 1 → Tail\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, X is a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Rolling a Fair Dice\n",
    "X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each outcome is assigned a numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Height of people attending an event\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible values:\n",
    "\n",
    "160 cm, 165 cm, 170.5 cm, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 1. Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable takes finite or countable values.\n",
    "\n",
    " Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tossing a coin\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling a dice\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of students present\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Continuous Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous random variable takes infinite values within a range.\n",
    "\n",
    " Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amount of rainfall tomorrow\n",

    "### ✅ What is a Histogram?\n",
    "A histogram is a plot that shows how often values occur in different intervals (called **bins**).  \n",

    "- 70–80 → 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "These bars create the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 What are Bins?\n",
    "Bins are the continuous ranges used to group data values.  \n",
    "Example bins: 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, etc.\n",

    "KDE is a smooth curve drawn over the histogram.  \n",
