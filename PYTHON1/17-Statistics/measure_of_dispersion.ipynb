    "### 📊 Measure of Dispersion :\n",
    "A measure of dispersion is a statistical measure that describes how spread out or scattered the data values are around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ Variance\n",
    "Variance is the average of the squared deviations of each observation from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population Variance\n",
    "σ² = (1 / N) * Σ (xᵢ − μ)²\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample Variance\n",
    "s² = (1 / (n − 1)) * Σ (xᵢ − x̄)²\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Standard Deviation\n",
    "Standard Deviation is the positive square root of variance and indicates average deviation of data from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population Standard Deviation\n",
    "\tσ = √[(1 / N) * Σ (xᵢ − μ)²]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample Standard Deviation\n",
    "\ts = √[(1 / (n − 1)) * Σ (xᵢ − x̄)²]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "xᵢ  = i-th observation\n",
    "μ   = population mean\n",
    "x̄   = sample mean\n",
    "N   = population size\n",
    "n   = sample size\n",
    "Σ   = summation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship\n",
    "  Standard deviation is the square root of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 In short:\n",
    "Variance measures spread using squared deviations\n",
    "Standard deviation measures actual spread in same unit as data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❓ Why We Use Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "- Measures of dispersion are used to know how much data values vary around the mean.\n",
    "- Mean alone cannot show data spread\n",
    "- Helps compare datasets\n",
    "- Shows consistency or variability\n",
    "- Indicates risk and uncertainty\n",
    "- Important in statistics and machine learning\n",
    "- Variance measures squared spread mathematically.\n",
    "Standard Deviation shows actual spread in the same unit as data, so it is easier to understand."

    "## 📌 Bessel’s Correction\n",
    "Bessel’s correction is a statistical adjustment in which we divide by (n − 1) instead of n when calculating sample variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used only for sample variance, not for population variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❓ Why Do We Need Bessel’s Correction?\n",
    "- When we calculate variance from a sample, we first compute the sample mean (x̄).\n",
    "- This sample mean is estimated from the same data, so the data points are slightly closer to x̄ than they would be to the true population mean (μ).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ As a result:\n",
    "- Squared deviations become smaller\n",
    "- Variance calculated using n becomes underestimated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔑 Role of (n − 1) – Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "After calculating the sample mean, only (n − 1) values are free to vary\n",
    "\n",
    "The last value is fixed because the sum of deviations from the mean must be zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "Degrees of Freedom = n − 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using (n − 1) compensates for the lost degree of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Formula with Bessel’s Correction\n",
    "Sample Variance:\n",
    "s² = (1 / (n − 1)) Σ (xᵢ − x̄)²\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we take a small sample from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the sample is small, using n makes variance too small\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing by (n − 1) slightly increases variance\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a better estimate of true population variance\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ When to Use What?\n",
    "Situation\tDenominator\n",
    "Population data\tN\n",
    "Sample data\tn − 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📝 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Bessel’s correction is used while computing sample variance to avoid underestimation. Since the sample mean is used, one degree of freedom is lost. Dividing by (n − 1) instead of n provides an unbiased estimate of population variance."
