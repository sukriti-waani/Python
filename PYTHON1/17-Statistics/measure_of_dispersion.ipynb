    "### 📊 Measure of Dispersion :\n",
    "A measure of dispersion is a statistical measure that describes how spread out or scattered the data values are around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ Variance\n",
    "Variance is the average of the squared deviations of each observation from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population Variance\n",
    "σ² = (1 / N) * Σ (xᵢ − μ)²\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample Variance\n",
    "s² = (1 / (n − 1)) * Σ (xᵢ − x̄)²\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Standard Deviation\n",
    "Standard Deviation is the positive square root of variance and indicates average deviation of data from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population Standard Deviation\n",
    "\tσ = √[(1 / N) * Σ (xᵢ − μ)²]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample Standard Deviation\n",
    "\ts = √[(1 / (n − 1)) * Σ (xᵢ − x̄)²]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "xᵢ  = i-th observation\n",
    "μ   = population mean\n",
    "x̄   = sample mean\n",
    "N   = population size\n",
    "n   = sample size\n",
    "Σ   = summation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship\n",
    "  Standard deviation is the square root of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 In short:\n",
    "Variance measures spread using squared deviations\n",
    "Standard deviation measures actual spread in same unit as data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❓ Why We Use Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "- Measures of dispersion are used to know how much data values vary around the mean.\n",
    "- Mean alone cannot show data spread\n",
    "- Helps compare datasets\n",
    "- Shows consistency or variability\n",
    "- Indicates risk and uncertainty\n",
    "- Important in statistics and machine learning\n",
    "- Variance measures squared spread mathematically.\n",
    "Standard Deviation shows actual spread in the same unit as data, so it is easier to understand."
