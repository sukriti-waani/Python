# Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer which set of instructions to repeat and how!

#  Types: 
# 1. while loops : These loops will continue to run as long as a certain condition is met.
# 2. for loops


# i = 1
# while(i < 6):
#   print(i)
#   i += 1


# print hello - 5 times using while loop
# i = 0
# while(i < 5):
#   print("Hello")
#   i += 1



# List using while loop
l = [1, "hey", "Python", 52, True, "Learn"]

i= 0
while(i < len(l)):
  print(l[i])
  i += 1
